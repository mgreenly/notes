This is my first experiment with GKE.

The goal here is just to get something up and running that can be improved on later.

## GKE

```
# TODO: add instructions to set the organization and create project
$> gcloud config set project logic-refinery-com
```

## Create cluster

First create the cluster.

I need to explore these options better.

```
gcloud beta container \
  clusters create "production" \
    --zone "us-central1-a" \
    --cluster-version "1.13.10-gke.0" \
    --machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
    --disk-type "pd-standard" \
    --disk-size "100" \
    --num-nodes "2" \
    --enable-ip-alias 
    --no-enable-basic-auth \
    --no-issue-client-certificate
    --no-enable-autoupgrade \
    --enable-autorepair
```

## Get Cluster Credentials

Get the credentials from the cluster we just created so that `kubectl` can connect.

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials production
```

## Deploy the apps

```
kubectl apply -f www.yaml
kubectl apply -f app.yaml
```

## Deploy Proxy

The haproxy config currently uses the cluster ips to direct traffic to each service but these will change the first time you deploy the service.

The easiest way to fix this would be if dns worked in the cluster but that addon doesn't seem to be enabled.

So for now edit the config so the IP addresses match the services.

do a `kubectl get services` to get the IPs of the www and app service and set them in the config.

The update that image and apply the config

```
kubectl apply -f proxy.yaml
```


## Firewall

Create a firewall rule that will allow the loadbalancer
to send traffic to the cluster.

Todo this I have to extgract the cluster tag some how?

```
gcloud compute \
  --project=logic-refinery-com \
  firewall-rules create logic-refinery-ingress \
  --direction=INGRESS \
  --priority=1000 \
  --network=default \
  --action=ALLOW \
  --rules=tcp:30080 \
  --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 \
  --target-tags=gke-production-c0f99aed-node
```

create load balancer

The backend will send traffic to 30080 and will also healthcheck on that port.

The front end should accept traffic on both 80 and 443.

Traffic on 80 will get redirected back to 443 by the proxy in the cluster.

The secure traffic whould be using the fixed ip of logic-refinery

```
#TODO: figure out the gcloud command line to create the load balancer
```
